* Produce different variations of the same quick course, without having to manually copy content nor create multiple git repositories.

== Prerequisites

This course assumes that you have the following prior experience:

* Experience using Antora, Asciidoc, and associated tooling.
* Ability to write sentences using the English language.
* If you miss any of the above, you can try faking knowedge with help of any AI assitant on your own risk. ;-)
