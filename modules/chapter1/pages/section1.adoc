= Section 1

Changed this section, just to test that, as I update main, I can sync (merge) those changes with nolinks, and still keep the changes from nolinks.

Of course, if you must change the files that are different in nolinks, after the merge you have to re-apply the edits that make the nolinks branch different from main.
