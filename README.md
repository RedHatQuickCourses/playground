# About this Training

This is NOT a real training. It's just a test bed to experiment with Antora features.

Right now, my goal is producing different variations of the same quick course, without having to manually copy contents nor create multiple git repositories.

The main branch is published on the standard GitHub pages, and the `nolinks` branch is in a subdirectory which is not reachable by standard Antora navigation but addressable explicity in the URL. Once you enter the pages from either branch, all of Antora navigation keeps works and stays inside the branch.

* [default](https://redhatquickcourses.github.io/) which redirects to [main](https://redhatquickcourses.github.io/playground/playground/1/) as the default GitHub Pages behavior.
* [nolinks](https://redhatquickcourses.github.io/playground/nolinks/)

Of course, you need to merge changes from main to nolinks, if you need to keep both versions of the course in sync.
