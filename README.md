# About this Training

This is NOT a real training. It's just a test bed to experiment with Antora features.

Right now, my goal is producing different variations of the same quick course, without having to manually copy content nor create multiple git repositories.

My custom GitHub Pages action makes the autogenerated link invalid (you know, the link close to "About" in the repository home page), but if you add the branch name as a directory in the URL, bot versions of the site are perfectly navigable:

* [main](https://redhatquickcourses.github.io/playground/main/)
* [nolinks](https://redhatquickcourses.github.io/playground/nolinks/)

Of course, you need to merge changes from main to nolinks, if you need to keep both versions of the course in sync.
